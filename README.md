Market segmentation is a strategy that divides a broad target market of customers into smaller, more similar groups, and then designs a marketing strategy specifically for each group. Clustering is a common technique for market segmentation since it automatically finds similar groups given a data set.

In this problem, we’ll see how clustering can be used to find similar groups of customers who belong to an airline’s frequent flyer program. The airline is trying to learn more about its customers so that it can target different customer segments with different types of mileage offers.

There are seven different variables in the dataset, described below:

Balance = number of miles eligible for award travel

QualMiles = number of miles qualifying for TopFlight status

BonusMiles = number of miles earned from non-flight bonus transactions in the past 12 months

BonusTrans = number of non-flight bonus transactions in the past 12 months

FlightMiles = number of flight miles in the past 12 months

FlightTrans = number of flight transactions in the past 12 months

DaysSinceEnroll = number of days since enrolled in the frequent flyer program
